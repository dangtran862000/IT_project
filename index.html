I have been living and studying in District 1 of Ho Chi Minh City for 20 years. Currently, I am a second-year student with my first semester in major that is a bachelor of information technology at RMIT Vietnam University. For me, the field of science and technology, especially information technology, has brought me the passion to learn new knowledge by the vastness of the IT world. I first encountered programming in grade 8, when it was the pascal programming language as an official subject in the school curriculum. I was intrigued by the command lines and the magic of computer algorithms. Since then, I have decided to enter the computer science class at high school and have achieved the silver medal for good students in IT. Besides, not only interested in technology but also music for example playing instruments and participating in volunteer activities are my hobbies. I hope that the time I spend studying and researching information technology will help me improve my professional knowledge and hands-on experience in the technology industry.</p>

Instead of choosing to become a doctor or pharmacist, I followed my passion and became a member of SST (School of Science and Technology). I have a great curiosity to explore the Data Industry, and I expect to be a Data Scientist. Our team name is called '4tech', which stands for 'Four for Technology.'

My hobbies are playing an instrument (piano and guitar), listening to music, and playing games. I like playing games and I’m curious about how they operate behind the scenes. I also like to sit on my computer doing research, so I think doing IT is suitable for me. I’ve had the basic knowledge about coding in Python 3.0+ as it was a part of the study program that I took part in.</p>

In the past, I used to have a strong passion for football and swimming because I can connect closer to my friends and I can train myself. I have won a championship in a competition in high school. I have to admit that it is the best experience and exciting during my high school lifetime. However, my passion for IT became large when I saw my big brother, a competitive programmer, solving many challenging database problems such as arrays, multidimensional arrays and matrices in an online contest every weekend. Then, I follow his path to solving problems on the Leetcode website and join a contest at the weekends.</p>

We would meet each other several times a week to share our progress together, giving feedback to each other and to inform whether there were any problems or something that we needed help with. Besides that, we also booked our lecturer for consulting occasionally, and we’ve booked another lecturer for our video recording section, given in the task. We found out that each one of us can do best at a specific area of the project we’re planning to do. For example, those areas are good at setting up GitHub works, good at HTML, and good at Python or efficiency at using Microsoft programs. We finished our assignment 2 for about 2 days before the given deadline and did a final check on the day before the deadline. </H5>

        <h3 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><u>Topic</u></h3>
    </div>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Since technology is a field that is growing exponentially over time, it is easy that newcomers can get confused with specific majors. Thus, the focus of our attention is going to make a website for online learning. The expected outcome of our website is going to share general knowledge in the IT fields. Later on, specific skills and how to enter the profession in a particular major without making any confusion will be introduced. We name that project with a “4-Tech Academic Coding Website" and the website name is "4Tech", which has several meanings. Firstly, "4" represents four members of this first project followed with "Technology". It also means implicit in "for technology", which is all our effort for technology.</h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">In order to achieve such things, having a strong knowledge of each particular field is a must. Initially, the general picture of this project heavily depends on the methodology of teaching, which means that a good programmer may not teach very well. Therefore, the main challenge of this project is how to validate that knowledge and demonstrate it in a friendly way. As a result, imparting knowledge efficiency and avoiding as many academic theories is vital to let beginners find interest in the course and later in their career paths. To implement those work successfully, consulting with professionals in our school and the advice of them is an essential part of the success of this project.</h5><br>
    <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:1000px" >
        <h3 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><u>Motivation</u></h3>
    </div>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The motivation we have mainly from what we have experienced as a beginner. Enrolling in the field that contains too many subfields and the difficulty of its applications in the real-world made us come up with the idea of online teaching. Our project not only assists people to learn new things but also reduces the time-consume of getting to a specific place to learn. Tired of getting around will result in the efficiency of performance and produce less effectiveness in obtaining new knowledge. Therefore, students may feel free to control their schedules and activities and be more open with the course they enrolled in. Also, this project can help us form a solid knowledge base during teaching. To be precise, teaching is also a form of learning and reminds us about previous experience and skills we have passed. </h5><br>
    <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:1000px" >
        <h3 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><u>Landscape</u></h3>
    </div>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The same idea of our projects is the Udemy website where people can purchase and join those courses. The courses in Udemy are various categories, in which the contributors are users. That platform has gained an enormous reputation for the success of learning online where their aim is professional adults and students, which means they have a wide range of customers. From the customer's standpoint, this platform is much more reliable compared to our website. However, because of the variety of categories and a bunch of courses and contributors, it is less likely that the quality of those courses can be good; therefore, our website will upgrade this point to meet customer’s desires. </h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Our website has many outstanding features that can attract newcomers and engage them in the course. Firstly, we provide a clear roadmap and a good vision for each online course that can let the pupil have a general view of what they are going to deal with and later in the future when they have finished this course. This action will keep them not confused and not get disoriented when they obtain new things. Secondly, providing tasks and questions after finishing each part of the courses may show their flaw in learning and let them revise the course again. Also, after they finish their course, there will be a small project for practicing and implementing some practical applications. It can be some projects that we have completed or some plans that others have done. This kind of work will make them engage and perform well later in the company. To end up, having a certificate of finishing this course, which is validated by some prestigious and quality organizations to ensure information and knowledge is adequate.</h5><br>

    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">In the age of technology, where more and more people want to learn more about the industry and to get their best in understanding it. During their process, they could head into some problems in their beginning stage. The aim of this project is to help new learners from all ages in the IT industry, coding to be specific, to achieve the basic knowledge of the coding language of their choice (Python, JAVA, HTML, etc.) and to create a platform that could help them strengthen their understanding in the language. Our aim for this project comes from our difficulties in learning experiences in the course, so we would want to help create something that could reduce the difficulties that most new learners can possibly come across. </h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Our goal for this project is to have a website that has a basic knowledge of coding languages (Python, HTML, JAVA, etc.). This section’s content will be researched and used with our knowledge gathered from lectures. The content will be checked and feedback by lecturers and students who achieved high achievements in the course, this will help increase the validity of our information in this section.</h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Besides, another goal for our website is that our website will have videos of basic guides on using the code. For this part, we will record our own use and test on the basic code. The recording will have the code segment and how the code will run alongside the explanation of the code use, which will be also checked and feedback by lectures. </h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Not only that, but our goal also includes a section that will provide the users who finished the course a certificate. The way we will do this is that we might connect to some centers or lectures in creating the certificate for the users. </h5><br>

    </div>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">In the first group meeting, all of our team members have presented their ideas from assignment 1. While all of these intentions seem unique and potential, we found we lost to associate with each one. Besides, we all eager to learn and share knowledge correlated with the technology field for everyone, expand the engagement and understanding of people about the information technology industry. Since we have explored several perspectives of the information technology industry such as Web developer, IT Security, and Data Science, we have specific information about what necessitates to be equipped for training as well as the pathways that everyone can thrive in technology. While studying and researching in an information technology professional environment as well as ourselves as IT students, we understand and experience the difficulties and challenges when first approaching programming languages and skills to work with coding. Sometimes students lose direction and do not know where to start courses and how to achieve a good result that can be applied to work and practice in the computer industry. For these reasons, we wish to be able to support and provide a platform for sharing experiences and knowledge through lectures, knowledge sharing forum that the 4-Tech team has received in the learning process. With all that point of view, we aspire to establish a website in order to serve their demands, such as education, searching, and distribution. </h5><br>

        <h4 class="w3-left"><i>Researching, Consulting, and Getting started:</i></h4>
    </div>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The 4-Tech team has come up with a specific 3-step plan to concretize ideas and divide this project into different phases and arrange them in a scientific order to improve project quality and achieve effective productivity. Brainstorming the idea of a project is the indispensable section in the first step not only of a plan but also the whole project in general. After getting an agreement on an idea, we began to research the concept. and consult and have a survey with current IT practitioners and researchers about the creativity and strengths and weaknesses of the idea of an online learning platform, which is the “4-Tech Academic Coding Website”. In order to achieve the schedule of the project as well as suit each member in the team, we decided to divide the whole team into two different divisions including a team responsible for the technical part of the project and one the department only focuses on the responsible content so that the content is appropriate for the educational environment. More specifically, look up the elements to make the website more unique, engaging, and effective than some existing platforms. This section will be illustrated in more detail in the progress section. </h5><br>

            <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:1000px" >
                <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>1. What are the famous websites that teach programming nowadays? </i></h5>
                <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>2. What are the similarities and differences between the above websites? Pros and cons? </i></h5>
                <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>3. What difficulty do students often encounter when accessing those websites for learning purposes?  </i></h5>
                <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>4. How can these problems be resolved? </i></h5>
                <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>And What makes our website distinctive and unique? </i></h5>
            </div>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">While the core questions above solve the problem of the improvement of the 4-Tech website, we have to do primary research on people's learning on online websites:</h5><br>

                <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>3. After completing the course, is the student requiring credits? What is the purpose of those credits?</i></h5>
                <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>4. Are students willing to pay for a quality course?</i></h5>
            </div>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">After finishing the primary and secondary research, the team members decided to begin. We convey this idea to our lecturers and some 2nd and 3rd-year students for their outlook and advice. In addition, we have also sent letters in order to perform this intention to many professors who have knowledge in the fields of information technology as well as education to obtain the best solution to implement this scheme. The advice and advice of experts and seniors will be recorded in the most specific way. These comments will be helpful for us to be able to evaluate the ideas that we have come up  with within the process from the beginning. Based on consultation minutes, we will give disadvantages and advantages when implementing this project to have timely corrections in the working process. We have received many deliberations upon the appearance of consult. Most of the evaluations give the problem our team is possessing and some clarifications. However, the most trustworthy answer is still our team striving to discover it and solve it.</h5><br>
